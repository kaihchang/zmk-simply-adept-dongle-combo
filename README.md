# Kai Simple + Ploopy Adept combo, and now with dongle!
Basically, ZMK dongle as central, connecting to 3 peripherals, left & right split and the trackball.

What's good about ZMK dongles?<br/>
- Almost immediate connection and wake-up from sleep mode.<br/>
- No more dependent from less stable Bluetooth connections.<br/>
- Extended battery life for both splits/peripherals.<br/>
- "Wireless" support for ZMK studio, able to change keymaps on the fly.<br/>

Surely there's something bad?<br/>
- Extra cost for a spare MCU, seeeduino nrf52840 sense in my case here.<br/>
- Takes up an extra USB slot on your device.
